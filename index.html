      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        characterized by acting data-driven, entrepreneurial and strategic along the entire customer journey and touchpoints.</p>

        <h3>Retail Media | Retail Marketing | COOP/"WKZ" | Trade Investment</h3>
        <p class="RetailMedia-paragraph"> I was fortunate to be able to build up one of the leading European <a href="https://www.douglas-marketing-solutions.com/">Retail Media Programs at Parfümerie Douglas</a> from scratch and manage it over 3 years.
          If executed well, data-driven Retail Media and Retail Marketing are posed to be a win-win for both, the Retailer and the partner. Whereas retailers seize incremental investments, primarily media budgets,
          partners benefit from highly targeted advertising solutions based on actual shopper insights and proven audiences at the POS or offsite amidst the cookiecalypse. <br>

        <h3>Buying & Category Management</h3>
        <p class="Buying-paragraph"> Customer-centric buying and category management is what I learned during my 5 years at Amazon, leading the vendor management in Grocery and having started my career in the Baby durables product line.
          I was a key member in the establishment of the Amazon Pantry program, established new categories such as soft drinks or durable meat, lead projects such as i) the warehouse expansion to CEE for the Consumables Division, ii) the integration
          of bottle deposit into the Amazon.de website, or ii) the coffee tax handling due to PAN EU warehouses.<br>
